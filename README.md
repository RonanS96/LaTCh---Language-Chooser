# LaTCh (Language and Technology Chooser)
"An online tool to choose a programming language". I created this website as part of my 4th year Honours projecy at Heriot-Watt University.

In terms of tech I used HTML, CSS and some JavaScript at the front end, with PHP working server side to connect this front end to an underlying MySQL database. I chose these technologies due to the fact that I had experience with most of them from previous years at university.

In terms of features the website has 3 main ones that could help a programmer choose a programming language or tool suitable for their needs - namely a questionnaire, categories section and a discussion board. I also implemented user accounts (regular users and admin users) with PHP session cookies. The idea for future development of this site was to turn it in to a "programmer's assistant" with built in tutorials and information pages about each and every programming language that could be edited and contributed to by the community.
