# LaTCh (Language and Technology Chooser)
"An online tool to choose a programming language". I created this website as part of my 4th year Honours projecy at Heriot-Watt University.

In terms of tech I used HTML, CSS and some JavaScript at the front end, with PHP working server side to connect this front end to an underlying MySQL database. The webiste was deployed to a university server. I chose these technologies due to the fact that I had experience with most of them from previous years at university.

In terms of features the website has 3 main ones that could help a programmer choose a programming language or tool suitable for their needs - namely a questionnaire, categories section and a discussion board. I also implemented user accounts (regular users and admin users) with PHP session cookies. The idea for future development of this site was to turn it in to a "programmer's assistant" with built in tutorials and information pages about each and every programming language that could be edited and contributed to by the community.

Looking back the tech I used on this project wasn't great and if I was to do the project again now I would definitely use more modern web technologies, most likely a JavaScript framework like React, Angular or Svelte. I would also put more priority on the UX, perhaps using a template to begin with. Despite this I did learn a lot about how web development works and I used tech that I was familiar with from my university courses. 

I received an **A grade** for the development for this website along with an accompanying dissertation document, which focused on which programming languages are the best to learn from beginner level to more experienced.
